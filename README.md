# Statitstical-Shattered-Pixel-Dungeon #

[OLD REPO](https://github.com/endlesssolitude/ShatteredPD-DetailedDesc)

A private mod of [ShatteredPixelDungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) working as a dictionary and a tester.

Aim to help dungeon players know the data and mechanics of game, and have a platform to test game data and mechanics.

Also a few expansions are added to the origin game which players can turn on with challenge window.

*****************NOTE THAT*****************

- All the description are ONLY available in CHINESE. 

- Currently this version is ONLY distributed in Tencent PD groups in China and NO plan for a wider release at least now.

*****************Main Features*****************

- Detailed descrption for most items, creatures, plants etc. and important mechanics of game. Some items is not described because the original desc is detailed enough.

- TestMode that has convinet access to most items, travel between floors, summon mobs and other crazy things.

- A few expansions for the original game. Expansions are quite limited because I dont want to make too much interferences with origin game.

- And other parts of the game is UNCHANGED to keep inline with the original ShatterdPD.

*****************More*****************

- This project is built with Android Studio. 

- Update (usually) each time when ShatteredPD releases a major version.

- You can just regard it as a dictionary.
